I've been picking up an old project of mine, starting in Feb 2018. It's another of those long
projects that'll take some time to reach fruition...

Build a complete Transputer-based OS (running on a modern version of a T800 emulator I initially
wrote several years ago), languages, port of eForth...

See the [**Parachute Project**]({{ base_path }}/parachute/) page for more information.

So far: I have a Macro Assembler, capable of assembling the Transputer port of eForth.
Next: Get the Transputer Emulator built for modern OSs...
