The third release of the Cross Platform Launcher Plugin is now available. 

This Maven 2 plugin allows you to create launchers for Java programs on Mac OS X, Windows and Linux.

See [**developer area**]({{ base_path }}/dev/xplp) for more information.

This release is tested on Windows 2000, Windows XP, Mac OS X 10.6 and Ubuntu Linux 10.04.1 LTS. 

Apart from testing on all platforms, this release...


* Fixes a Linux launching bug where the error code was not being returned correctly
* Changed the Windows-specific janelType configuration property to be available in all builds, and renamed it launcherType. It only makes sense on Windows or MacOSX. Use of janelType now fails the build with a message saying "use launcherType". On MacOSX, use the console launcherType to create a structure like that used on Linux; GUI is still the default and still creates a .app structure.
