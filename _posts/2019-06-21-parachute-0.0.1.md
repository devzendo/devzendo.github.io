The first full release of the Parachute Parallel Processing Environment - 0.0.1 - is now
available.

Parachute is a portable, open source emulation of the T800+ series of Inmos Transputers - see the emulator
release notes for detail.

This has taken about 16 months to transform an old project that built on a single system,
into a multi-architecture platform that will form the basis of future language experiments. 

See the [**Parachute Main Page**]({{ base_path }}/parachute) for more information, and
[**Parachute Downloads**]({{ base_path }}/parachute-download) for the download links for macOS,
Windows, Ubuntu, Raspbian and CentOS.
