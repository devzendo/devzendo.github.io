The first release of the Cross Platform Launcher Plugin is now available. 

This Maven 2 plugin allows you to create launchers for Java programs on Mac OS X, Windows and Linux. At this time, only Mac OS X is fully tested in this release - the others should work, but were not the focus of this iteration.

See [**developer area**]({{ base_path }}/dev/xplp) for more information.
