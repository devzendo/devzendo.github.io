This takes part of the MiniMiser Framework - dealing with common
operations surrounding the use of embedded databases in applications
(creating, opening, upgrading, closing, implementing the DAO pattern) -
and rewrites it in Scala. It is a wrapper providing access to an
embedded H2 database via Spring-JDBC.

This is also the second of our releases made available via the Central
Maven Repository. Various utility libraries that this project uses are
also being released into Central, rather than our own Subversion-based
repository.

The framework can be found on [its own page]({{ base_path }}/dev/common-db), and has
a [short user guide]({{ base_path }}/dev/common-db.pdf).
