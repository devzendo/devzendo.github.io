The second release of the Cross Platform Launcher Plugin is now available. 

This Maven 2 plugin allows you to create launchers for Java programs on Mac OS X, Windows and Linux. At this time, only Mac OS X is fully tested in this release - the others should work, but were not the focus of this iteration.

See [**developer area**]({{ base_path }}/dev/xplp) for more information.

This release is tested on Windows 2000, Windows XP, Mac OS X 10.6 and Ubuntu Linux 10.04.1 LTS. 

Apart from testing on all platforms, this release adds support for the Maven NAR Plugin, in order to create launchers for projects that incorporate JNI code.
