The eighth release of the Cross Platform Launcher Plugin is now available.

This Maven 2 plugin allows you to create launchers for Java programs on
Mac OS X, Windows and Linux.

See its page in the [**developer area**]({{ base_path }}/dev/xplp) for more information.

This release changes the way Maven metadata is retrieved from javadoc annotations to java
annotations.

It also now builds on Java 8, and fixes bugs.

For Windows, added the janelDirectory option (can be bin, or root) - where the janel .exe/.lap/.dll files
will be stored: in a bin directory, or directly in the root (the backwards-compatible default).
