When I started this project as a proper 'home' for my open source
projects, I chose Google Code as the hosting service for source
repositories. I needed to host projects using Subversion and either Git
or Mercurial (it had to be something distributed); I chose Mercurial at
that time. 

I've tried Git and GitHub, but after having a catastrophic
loss of repository with a Git project, am a little wary of it. Most of
the projects here are now hosted as Mercurial projects at Bitbucket,
with some Git at Github.

I don't like Git, mostly due to its complexity. However it has become
the de facto standard, so I'll have to get used to it. The rise of
worse is better, perhaps.
