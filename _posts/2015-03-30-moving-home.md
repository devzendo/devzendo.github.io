When I started this project as a proper 'home' for my open source
projects, I chose Google Code as the hosting service for source
repositories. I needed to host projects using Subversion and either Git
or Mercurial (it had to be something distributed); I chose Mercurial at
that time. I've tried Git and GitHub, but after having a catastrophic
loss of repository with a Git project, feel that it doesn't have the
reliability I need. (OK, countless projects choose Git and I'm very
happy for them; I've got an existence proof demonstrating it isn't
right for me yet).
