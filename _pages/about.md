DevZendo.org was formed in 2009 by [**Matt Gumbley**]({{ base_path }}/members/) as a distribution point for his
larger-scale open source projects.
 
These are split into:

- [**applications**]({{ base_path }}/applications/): programs intended for users, with a strong emphasis on aesthetics, ease of use, zero-tolerance of bugs and minimal, but essential features
- the [**developer area**]({{ base_path }}/developer-area): libraries, frameworks and scripts intended for software developers who share our ethos

It is hoped that a community of like-minded
developers and users will form to use, and take these projects forward.

We are *Software Crafters*, inspired by the idea of Software Craftsmanship[^1]
(although preferring a gender-neutral term), and develop using the open
source model since it affords us the best opportunity to create quality.

[^1]: [The Manifesto of Software Craftsmanship](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/) 

> "In spite of the rise of Microsoft and other giant producers, software
  remains in large part a craft industry. Because of the enormous variety
  of specialized applications, there will always be room for individuals
  to write software based on their unique knowledge. There will always be
  niche markets to keep small software companies alive. The craft of writing
  software will not become obsolete. And the craft of using software creatively
  is flourishing even more than the craft of writing it." 
>  
> -- Freeman Dyson, Science as a Craft Industry.

We favour modern, cross-platform development languages, such as Java & Scala.
We're experimenting with Swift, Elm, Haskell, Erlang and Perl 6.
We don't tolerate bad tech such as the JavaScript ecosystem
and its 'framework du jour' approach. We'll occasionally write in
dynamic languages, but not at scale. That way lies madness. Strict,
strong typing, machine-checked contracts, types first, property-based
tests, and unit testing are the way here.

We place a high value on the quality of our software, as measured using
several static analysis and metric analysis tools; we strive to remove
complexity where it arises, to ensure our code is understandable by our
developers and those who depend on it. We use continuous integration to
ensure that our software is always in a state where it can be released.

Our approach is best explained in [several popular books on software
crafting]({{ base_path }}/software-crafting-books/).
