Matt Gumbley founded DevZendo.org in 2009 as a place where a community might grow around his larger Open Source projects. He has been involved in smaller Open Source projects since 1997, with several larger Java projects being started but not reaching viability. The projects on this site are the ones that he thinks are release-worthy.
