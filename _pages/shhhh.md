This is one of our projects that isn't quite ready to be released yet.

One of the ideas of Open Source software is "release early, release often",
but we don't necessarily think that's best - wait until something "has legs",
or stands a chance of being useful, before releasing. There's too much
low-quality, alpha-release, rough, unfinished, abandoned stuff out there.
Let's not add to that.
