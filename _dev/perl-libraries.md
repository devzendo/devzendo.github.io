## Ham-WorldMap
Creates an Imager image containing an equirectangular projection of the world map, with optional
Maidenhead locator grid and day/night illumination showing the area of enhanced propagation known as the 'grey line'.
Also utility methods for adding dots at locator positions or lat/long coords, and filling grid squares with colour
to provide a 'heat map' of activity from these squares.

## Ham-WSJTX-Logparse
