I'm aiming for all DevZendo.org software to have a regular release schedule (developers can always update from the source repository). 

Emergency releases will be made as needed of course, but regular releases of bug fixes and new functionality will happen for all products around the same date.

The dates stay the same each year, and are:

<ul>
<li>Spring Equinox - March 20th</li>
<li>Beltane - April 30th</li>
<li>Midsummer - June 21st</li>
<li>Lughnasadh / Lammas - August 1st</li>
<li>Autumn Equinox - September 20th</li>
<li>Samhain (Halloween) - October 31st</li>
<li>Yule / Winter Solstice - December 20th</li>
<li>Imbolc - February 1st</li>
</ul>

They're the dates of Pagan festivals, in case you were wondering.
